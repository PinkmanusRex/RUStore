The protocol is thusly
byte[] pack
first byte is defines the request or response type
subsequently the remaining bytes are logically as follows
[len, data], where len is an int (so read in 4 bytes) that describe how many bytes long the data is

for messages that send key values, a byte[] will be sent that is structured
[type][len, key][len, value]
for messages that only send keys
[type][len, key]
for messages that only send the type
[type]
for the list of keys
[type][number of entries][len, key][len, key]...[len, key]
